## About the Challenge
The **100 Days of Code** challenge is a commitment to coding for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days. My primary language for this challenge is **Java**. I’ll be sharing daily updates, code snippets, and learning notes here.

## Goals
1. Strengthen my Java fundamentals and syntax understanding.
2. Explore core concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming, data structures, and algorithms.
3. Build mini-projects and complete coding exercises.
4. Document my progress to keep track of what I learn each day.

## Projects
Some of the projects I plan to work on include:
- **Project 1:** Basic Calculator
- **Project 2:** To-Do List Application
- **Project 3:** Banking System
- **Project 4:** Mini Games (Tic-Tac-Toe, Guess the Number, etc.)
- **Project 5:** Data Structures Implementations (Linked List, Queue, Stack)

## Resources
Here are some of the resources I’m using:
- [Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-java) for coding exercises
- Books: *Effective Java* by Joshua Bloch, *Java: The Complete Reference* by Herbert Schildt
